=========

[att]
    Match when the element sets the "att" attribute, whatever the value of the attribute. 
[att=val]
    Match when the element's "att" attribute value is exactly "val". 
[att~=val]
    Represents an element with the att attribute whose value is a white space-separated list of words, one of which is exactly "val". 
    If "val" contains white space, it will never represent anything (since the words are separated by spaces). 
    If "val" is the empty string, it will never represent anything either. 
[att|=val]
    Represents an element with the att attribute, its value either being exactly "val" or beginning with "val"
